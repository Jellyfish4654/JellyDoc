# Learning Java

Java is a versatile and object-oriented programming language widely adopted in FTC (First Tech Challenge) programming. While there are countless online resources available to learn coding, one standout is [Hyperskill](https://hi.hyperskill.org/) by JetBrains. Notably, JetBrains is the developer behind both the Kotlin programming language and the IntelliJ IDE. The latter serves as the foundational software for Android Studio, the primary IDE utilized in FTC.

## Hyperskill

Choose _Introduction to Java_ as your track. Progress at your own pace. Whether it takes you a month or a year to grasp the fundamentals, it's all valid. Our team aims for members to be equipped to code the robot by their second year on the team, not to have instant expertise.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  In your first year with the programming team, our goal for you is to learn the
  fundamental concepts of java. We encourage you to explore other fields of the
  robotics club such as build, outreach, and most importantly, to have fun!

### Curriculum Order

- Follow the track until the topic _String_
- After completing the topic _String_, skip to the topic _Multidimensional array_
- Return to the topic _Final variables_ and continue until the topic _Fields and methods in enum_
- You can stop once you reach this point

After completing the necessary curriculum, coding the robot should become easy
