# Control Theory

Control Theory is a branch of engineering that focuses on the dynamics and behavior of systems. Leveraging both algebra and calculus, it offers tools to analyze, predict, and shape system responses to achieve desired outcomes, ensuring stability and resilience against disturbances and uncertainties.

## Closed Loop System

A closed-loop control system, also known as a feedback control system, utilizes a controller (algorithm) to adjust the system's input based on its observed output. In other words, a closed-loop system employs feedback from the system's output to fine-tune its input, ensuring the system achieves and maintains the desired outcome.

## Gain

Gain is a proportional value that shows the relationship between the magnitude of the input to the magnitude of the output signal at steady state. In other words, gain is the ratio of the change in input to change in the output.

## PID Controller

A PID controller stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller and is one of the most commonly used feedback controllers.

### Proportional Term

The Proportional term drives the position error to zero. The proportional term provides an output value that is directly proportional to the current error.

$$
P(t) = K_p \times e(t)
$$

Where:

- $K_p$ is the proportional gain.
- $e(t)$ is the current error

### Derivative Term

The Derivative term drives the velocity error to zero. This term predicts the trend of the error by evaluating its rate of change, acting to dampen the system response and prevent overshooting.

$$
D(t) = K_d \times \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

Where:

- $K_d$ is the derivative gain.
- $\frac{de(t)}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the error.

### Integral Term

The Integral term accumulates the sum of past errors. In other words, it's the integral of the error with respect to time. The steady-state error is the difference between the desired final output and the actual one, indicating an error that has persisted over time. The integral term eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs within a controller.

$$
I(t) = K_i \times \int e(t) \, dt
$$

Where:

- $K_i$ is the integral gain.
- $\int e(t) \, dt$ is the integral of the error over time.

### Combining the Terms

The complete control output $u(t)$ from the PID controller is the sum of these three terms:

$$
u(t) = K_p \times e(t) + K_d \times \frac{de(t)}{dt} + K_i \times \int e(t) \, dt
$$

### Tuning

1. Start with $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ at 0.
2. Increase $K_p$ until steady-state error is low.
3. Increase $K_i$ until steady-state error is removed entirely.
4. Increase $K_d$ until oscillations are removed.

## Feedforward Control

Feedforward aims to maintain or achieve a desired output by considering the system's dynamics and the known or expected disturbances. Input voltage (power) is proportional to force and gravity is a constant force, so a constant voltage feedforward can compensate for gravity.

## Filters

A filter is a causal system that filters information through a
probabilistic model to produce an estimate of a desired quantity that canâ€™t be measured
directly. It smooths the noise level which is the standard deviation of the sensor.

### Low-pass filter

A low-pass filter filters signals by only allowing low frequency signals to pass through. Noise is often comprised of high-frequency components, and by using a low-pass filter, it allows you to elimintate high noise frequencies and obtain a clear, and stable signal.

```java
double a = 0.9;
LowPassFilter filter = new LowPassFilter(a);
while (true) {
    double currentValue = readNoisySensor();
    double estimate = filter.estimate(currentValue);
}
```

### Phase Lag

While filters, such as the low-pass type, are beneficial in reducing noise levels, they come with a trade-off known as phase lag. Phase lag refers to the delay or shift in phase of the output signal compared to the input signal. As filters work by processing and averaging the input signals, they inherently introduce some time delay, which results in this lag. 

### Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a recursive filter that provides optimal estimates of the state of a system, based on a series of measurements over time. Rather than merely relying on past measurements like some other filters, the Kalman filter operates by *projecting the state forward*, using a mathematical model of the system. This forward projection allows the Kalman filter to anticipate where the system is going, making it adept at handling noisy measurements. Compared to a low-pass filter, a significant advantage of the Kalman filter is that it typically introduces less lag, making its estimates more timely and accurate. 

```java
double Q = 0.3;
double R = 3;
int N = 3;
KalmanFilter filter = new KalmanFilter(Q,R,N);
while (true) {
    double currentValue = readNoisySensor();
    double estimate = filter.estimate(currentValue);
}
```
