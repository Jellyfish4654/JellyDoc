# Mecanum TeleOp

## Mecanum Wheels

- **Unique Configuration**: Mecanum wheels have unique rollers positioned at a 45-degree angle around the wheel.
- **Holonomic Movement**: These wheels enable a robot to move in any horizontal direction without changing the wheels' or robot's orientation.
- **Vector Force**: Rotating Mecanum wheels generate a 45-degree force vector, combining to move the robot.
- **X Configuration**: The wheels are mounted to form an 'X' pattern when viewed from above, crucial for omnidirectional movement.

## Mecanum Wheel Control

y = forward velocity\
x = strafe velocity \* l\
r = rotational velocity\
denominator=max(Math.abs(y)+Math.abs(x)+Math.abs(r),1)\

frontLeftMotor = (y + x + r)/denominator\
backLeftMotor = (y - x + r)/denominator\
frontRightMotor = (y - x - r)denominator\
backRightMotor = (y + x - r)/denominator\

## Deriving Mecanum Wheel Control

Let break the down to understand it

Motors = y

Forward/Back movement is obvious, however, there are still a few things to note.\
Remember that joysticks have an interval of `-1 to 1`.\
Motors moves counterclockwise so you want to reverse the y direction:\
`double y = -gamepad1.left_stick_y;`\

leftMotors = y+r\
rightMotors = y-r\

Now in our current form, we have a differential drive/tank drive, enabling differential steering.

If both sticks are pushed at the same time, it will cause the robot to move in a curve\
leftMotors = 1+1 = 2 (Clipped to 1)\
rightMotors = 1-1 = 0\

We add the final x value to enable omnidirectional movement based on the direction of the vector forces for each wheel.

frontLeftMotor = y + x + r

backLeftMotor = y - x + r

frontRightMotor = y - x - r

backRightMotor = y + x - r

f = strafe adjustment factor = tracklength/trackwidth
The strafe adjustment factor counteracts imperfect strafing caused by the difference between tracklength and trackwidth.

The SDK simply clips to the range `-1 to 1`. This causes us to lose the ratio between the wheel velocities, leading to deviations from the robot's intended path. The denominator normalizes the velocity of the wheels to ensure that all the powers maintain the same ratio when the largest powerâ€™s absolute value exceeds 1.
