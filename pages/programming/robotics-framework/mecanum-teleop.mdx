# Mecanum TeleOp

## Mecanum Wheels

- **Unique Configuration**: Mecanum wheels have unique rollers positioned at a 45-degree angle around the wheel.
- **Holonomic Movement**: These wheels enable a robot to move in any horizontal direction without changing the wheels' or robot's orientation.
- **Vector Force**: Rotating Mecanum wheels generate a 45-degree force vector, combining to move the robot.
- **X Configuration**: The wheels are mounted to form an 'X' pattern when viewed from above, crucial for omnidirectional movement.

## Mecanum Wheel Control

$$
f = \text{strafe adjustment factor} \\

y = \text{forward velocity} \\
x = \text{strafe velocity} \times f \\
r = \text{rotational velocity}
$$

$$
\text{denominator} = \max(\lvert y \rvert + \lvert x \rvert + \lvert r \rvert, 1) \\
\text{frontLeftMotor} = \frac{y + x + r}{\text{denominator}} \\
\text{backLeftMotor} = \frac{y - x + r}{\text{denominator}} \\
\text{frontRightMotor} = \frac{y - x - r}{\text{denominator}} \\
\text{backRightMotor} = \frac{y + x - r}{\text{denominator}}
$$

## Deriving Mecanum Wheel Control

Let break the down to understand it:

$$
Motors = y
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

</div>

Forward/Back movement is obvious, however, there are still a few things to note. Remember that joysticks have an interval of `-1 to 1`. Motors moves counterclockwise so you want to reverse the y direction: \
`double y = -gamepad1.left_stick_y;`

$$
\text{leftMotors} = y + r \\
\text{rightMotors} = y - r
$$

Now in our current form, we have a differential drive/tank drive, enabling differential steering.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  ![Image](/assets/rotation.png)
</div>

If both sticks are pushed at the same time, it will cause the robot to move in a curve.

$$
\text{leftMotors} = 1 + 1 = 2 \, (\text{Clipped to } 1) \\
\text{rightMotors} = 1 - 1 = 0
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  ![Image](/assets/curve.png)
</div>

We add the final x value to enable omnidirectional movement based on the direction of the vector forces for each wheel.

$$
\text{frontLeftMotor} = y + x + r
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  ![Image](/assets/FL.png)
</div>

$$
\text{backLeftMotor} = y - x + r
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  ![Image](/assets/BL.png)
</div>

$$
\text{frontRightMotor} = y - x - r
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  ![Image](/assets/FR.png)
</div>

$$
\text{backRightMotor} = y + x - r
$$

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
![Image](/assets/BR.png)
</div>
$$
f = \text{strafe adjustment factor} = \frac{\text{track length}}{\text{track width}}
$$

The strafe adjustment factor counteracts imperfect strafing caused by the difference between tracklength and trackwidth.

The SDK simply clips to the range `-1 to 1`. This causes us to lose the ratio between the wheel velocities, leading to deviations from the robot's intended path. The `denominator` normalizes the velocity of the wheels to ensure that all the powers maintain the same ratio when the largest power’s absolute value exceeds 1.

## Field Centric

With our current setup, the joystick controls the direction of the robot relative to the frame of the robot. One common driver enhancement is field centric driving, where to robot joystick controls the direction of the robot relative field/driver rather than the frame of the robot.

<style jsx>{`
  .video-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */
  }

  .video-wrapper iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
`}</style>

<div className="video-wrapper">
  <iframe

</div>

To achieve this, the x/y components of the joysticks are rotated counter to the robot’s angle. We get the robot's heading (angle) from the IMU. The IMU is a sensor inside of the control hub which returns the pitch, yaw, and heading of the robot.

Formula for Rotating a Vector:

$$
x_2 = \cos \beta x_1 - \sin \beta y_1 \\
y_2 = \sin \beta x_1 + \cos \beta y_1
$$

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Proof of this formula can be found

The translation joystick values need to be counterrotated by the robot heading. The IMU returns heading, however we need to rotate the movement counter to the robot’s rotation, so its negative is taken.
