# Mecanum TeleOp

## Mecanum Wheels

- **Unique Configuration**: Mecanum wheels have unique rollers positioned at a 45-degree angle around the wheel.
- **Holonomic Movement**: These wheels enable a robot to move in any horizontal direction without changing the wheels' or robot's orientation.
- **Vector Force**: Rotating Mecanum wheels generate a 45-degree force vector, combining to move the robot.
- **X Configuration**: The wheels are mounted to form an 'X' pattern when viewed from above, crucial for omnidirectional movement.

## Mecanum Wheel Control

y = forward velocity (forward/backward)\
x = strafe velocity (left/right)\
r = rotational velocity\

frontLeftMotor = y + x + r\
backLeftMotor = y - x + r\
frontRightMotor = y - x - r\
backRightMotor = y + x - r\

## Deriving Mecanum Wheel Control

Let break the down to understand it

Motors = y

Forward/Back movement is obvious, however, there are still a few things to note.\
Remember that joysticks have an interval of `-1 to 1`.\
Motors moves counterclockwise so you want to reverse the y direction:\
`double y = -gamepad1.left_stick_y;`\

leftMotors = y+r\
rightMotors = y-r\

Now in our current form, we have a differential drive/tank drive, enabling differential steering.

If both sticks are pushed at the same time, it will cause the robot to move in a curve\
leftMotors = 1+1 = 2 (Clipped to 1)\
rightMotors = 1-1 = 0\

We add the final x value to enable omnidirectional movement based on the direction of the vector forces for each wheel.
