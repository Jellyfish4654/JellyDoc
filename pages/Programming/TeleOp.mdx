# TeleOp

TeleOp, the driver-controlled phase, is divided into two roles: the primary driver, responsible for movement, and the secondary driver, overseeing intake. We maintain a consistent framework for our TeleOp annually but innovate with complex algorithms and driver enhancements to achieve the **Control Award**.
