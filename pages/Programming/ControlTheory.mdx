# Control Theory

Control Theory is a branch of engineering that focuses on the dynamics and behavior of systems. Leveraging both algebra and calculus, it offers tools to analyze, predict, and shape system responses to achieve desired outcomes, ensuring stability and resilience against disturbances and uncertainties.

## Closed Loop System

A closed-loop control system, also known as a feedback control system, utilizes a controller (algorithm) to adjust the system's input based on its observed output. In other words, a closed-loop system employs feedback from the system's output to fine-tune its input, ensuring the system achieves and maintains the desired outcome.

## PID Controller

A PID controller stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller and is one of the most commonly used feedback controllers.

### Proportional Term

The Proportional term drives the position error to zero. The proportional term provides an output value that is directly proportional to the current error.
