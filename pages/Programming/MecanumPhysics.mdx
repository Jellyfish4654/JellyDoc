# Mecanum Physics

The rollers on mecanum wheels form a 45° degree angle with the wheel’s axis of rotation. This also means that mecanum drivetrains can’t strafe as fast as they can drive forward. The key to the omnidirectional movement of mecanum wheels are the force vectors. Depending on how the wheels are driven, the longitudinal force vectors or the transverse vectors can cancel each other out. Here are a few examples of how the wheels must be driven to achieve different movements:

## Imperfect Strafing

Mecanum wheels inherently move faster in the forward/backward direction due to roller slippage. To correct imperfect strafing, adjust the left X value; this refines non-axis aligned and field-centric driving. While this guide recommends a 1.1 multiplier, optimal settings will vary between drivetrains.
