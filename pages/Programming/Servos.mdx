# Servo Initialization

Just like for Motors, servos are initialized through the hardwareMap object.

```java
Servo testServo;
testServo = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "testServo");
```

# Setting Servo Position

The setPosition method accepts a double value between 0 and 1 to set a specified position on non-CR servos.

```java
testServo.setPosition(0.5);
```

# CR Servos

CR Servos (Continuous Rotation Servos) are a mode for servos where the servo continuously rotates, similar to the movement of a motor.

# CR Servo Initialization

CR Servos have a slightly different initialization:

```java
CRservo testCRServo;
testCRServo = hardwareMap.get(CRServo.class, "testCRServo");
```

# Setting CR Servo Powers

To use a CR Servo, apply the desired power using the setPower method; this is similar to setting a motor's power.

```java
testCRServo.setPower(0.5);
```

# Servo Overshoot/Stalling

Overshoot happens when a servo motor attempts to move past its physical limit, leading to erratic or bouncing movements. Persistent pushing against this limit can cause stalling or binding, potentially resulting in "servo hunting" â€” a state of continuous oscillation as the servo tries unsuccessfully to reach the target position. To prevent damage in mechanisms like claws, avoid overly tight grips on objects.
